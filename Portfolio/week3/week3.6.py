# 6. Write a program that displays the "Seven Times Table". That is, the result of
# multiplying 7 by every number from 0 to 12 inclusive. The output might start:
# 0 x 7 = 0
# 1 x 7 = 7
# 2 x 7 = 14
# and so on.

for i in range(0, 13):  # Loop through numbers 0 to 12 inclusive
    print(i, "* 7 =", (i * 7))  # Display the result of multiplying 7 by each number in the range
