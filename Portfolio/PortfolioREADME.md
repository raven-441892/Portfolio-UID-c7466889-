Overview':
This portfolio folder serves as a comprehensive collection of weekly tasks for our Fundamental of Computer Programming course. Within it, you'll find a structured breakdown of weekly assignments, each designed to delve into key aspects of Python fundamentals.

These tasks cover a wide array of foundational topics:

Variables: Exploring how to store and manipulate data by assigning values to variables.

Functions: Understanding the building blocks of reusable code segments for specific tasks.

Lists: Learning about ordered collections, allowing for the storage and manipulation of multiple items.

Tuples: Understanding immutable sequences used for storing collections of items.

Sets: Exploring unordered collections used for storing unique elements.

Dictionaries: These are collections of key-value pairs, allowing efficient storage and retrieval of data. 
Tasks related to dictionaries will teach you how to manipulate, access, and modify data using keys and values within this data structure.

File Handling: Understanding how to read from and write to files is a vital skill in programming. Tasks related to file handling will cover 
concepts such as opening, reading, writing, and closing files in Python. You'll learn how to interact with different file types, manipulate 
data within files, and manage file streams effectively.

Beyond these, there are many more fundamental concepts waiting to be explored. Each week, you'll encounter tasks that guide you through practical exercises, helping to solidify your understanding of Python's foundational principles. These exercises aim to provide a hands-on learning experience, allowing you to apply theoretical knowledge to real coding scenarios. Through this structured approach, you'll gain a robust grasp of Python programming essentials, laying a strong foundation for your further learning and development.
